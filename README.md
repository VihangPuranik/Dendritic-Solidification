# Dendritic-Solidification

Dendritic microstructures result from undercooling of the melt, where variable solute
concentration can lead to localized constitutional undercooling.
Analytical solutions for dendritic growth are limited to very simple situations and numerical
simulations are playing an increasing role in studies of dendrites. In the simulation, the
melt is assumed to be stationary. Phase-field methods have been extended to simulate the growth
of 6 fold two-dimensional symmetric dendrites.

The simulated results show the growth of the dendrites at different timesteps:
